This is the source tree of U-Boot, a popular boot loader for embedded devices. U-Boot was developed by DENX Software Engineering (www.denx.de).

This particular version of U-Boot is a fork of the version maintained by Emcraft Systems.

The fork implements support for the Readout Control Unit 2 (RCU2) of the ALICE Time-Projection Chamber (TPC).

Board files:

board/UiB/rcu-2.0:

In addition to this, the Spansion SPI flash driver was updated with support for S25FL256:
